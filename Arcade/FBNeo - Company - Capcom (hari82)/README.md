## Description

All Capcom Arcade games for FBNeo. Based on the listing at [Wikipedia: List of
Capcom games
0-D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Capcom_games:_0%E2%80%93D) as a reference. Only a couple of quiz games in Japanese are left out, and maybe a mahjong. Roms choice tend to prefer parent Rom, but with some exceptions:

- Japanese version of "Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo", because the Western release has messed up difficulty.
