## Description

Arcade racing games for FinalBurn Neo, in which the player does some sort of
racing against other players or the time. Games primarily being an action
shooter, while driving or a survival focus is not a racing game to me. There
are maybe one or two exceptions to this rule, because they were so interesting
to play. I also excluded some games that would fit, but wasn't fun to play in
my opinion. This is a highly subjective collection.
