replace the paths and probably file extensions in the playlist to adapt it into
your environment.

## Description

Recreation of the current selection from [Nintendo Switch Online for SEGA
Genesis](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sega-genesis-nintendo-switch-online-switch/).
The No-Intro Rom name sets are used to build the playlist paths. When possible,
I used the first US release, not a revision or any of the Virtual Console or
Switch re-releases. Additional notes:

- For "Mega Man - The Wily Wars" I made an exception and added the Genesis Mini
  version. Because the US version did not got officially released to the console,
  and I prefer the 60 Hz version over the European one.
