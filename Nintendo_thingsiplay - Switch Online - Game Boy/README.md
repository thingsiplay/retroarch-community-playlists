## Description

Recreation of the current selection from [Nintendo Switch Online for Game
Boy](https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/online/nintendo-switch-online/classic-games/).
The No-Intro Rom name sets are used to build the playlist paths. Additional
notes:

- Nintendo mixed Game Boy and Game Boy Color games in one list.

Note: This playlist contains Rom paths with two different directory structures
for `gb` and `gbc` . Make sure to have them both replaced.
