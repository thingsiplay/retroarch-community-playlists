replace the paths and probably file extensions in the playlist to adapt it into

## Description

Recreation of the current selection from [Nintendo Switch Online for Nintendo
Entertainment
System](https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/online/nintendo-switch-online/classic-games/).
The No-Intro Rom name sets are used to build the playlist paths. When possible,
I used the first US release, not a revision or any of the Virtual Console or
Switch re-releases. Additional notes:

- "Mystery Tower" is known as Japanese title "Babel no Tou" in this playlist.
- Japanese version of "Super Mario Bros. 2" (known as Lost Levels in the US)
  never got a release on the original NES hardware, but for the Famicom Disk
  System (fds). It is named "Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels" in the Switch
  Online, and is known as Rom title "Super Mario Bros 2 (Japan) (En)" in the
  playlist.
- "VS. Excitebike" is another Famicom Disk System (fds) game. It has additional
  multiplayer functionality, save to disk and different music.

Note: This playlist contains Rom paths with two different directory structures
for `nes` and `fds` . Make sure to have them both replaced.
