## Description

Recreation of the current selection from [Nintendo Switch Online for Super
Nintendo Entertainment
System](https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/online/nintendo-switch-online/classic-games/).
The No-Intro Rom name sets are used to build the playlist paths. When possible,
I used the first US release, not a revision or any of the Virtual Console or
Switch re-releases. Additional notes:

- "Amazing Hebereke" is known as Japanese title "Sugoi Hebereke" in this
  playlist.
- "Kirby's Super Star Stacker" is known as Japanese title "Kirby no Kirakira
  Kids" in this playlist.
- "Mario's Super Picross" is known as Japanese title "Mario no Super Picross"
  in this playlist.
- "Super Puyo Puyo 2" is known as Japanese title "Super Puyo Puyo Tsuu" in this
  playlist.
- "Bombuzal" is the Japanese title and is known in US as "Ka-Blooey" in this
  playlist.
- "Caveman Ninja" is also known as "Joe & Mac" in this playlist.
- "Smash Tennis" is known as Japanese title "Super Family Tennis" in this
  playlist (prefer 60 Hz).
- "Pop'n TwinBee" is the PAL version in the Switch Online, but I included the
  Japanese version in this playlist (prefer 60 Hz).
